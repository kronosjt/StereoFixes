// Constant registers that will arrive in Vertex and Pixel Shaders, as
// c49.  You can define any constant register as long as it is not used in any other shader in the game. Check for the desired constant register in the Dumps folder to find out if any other shander uses it. The constants below will be assigned, based on the key preset. In this game only c49 works. Higher values like c220 do not work.

// For this single key example, we only need one keylist, KEY1. This specifies
// that the Numpad 0 keyboard key (Key=96) should act as a toggle. And toggle
// between the two Presets of PRES1, PRES2.  Which will change the Const1 being 
// passed to the shader code from 1.0 to 0.0 as floating point numbers.
// Type=1 is toggle, Type=2 is momentary.  The value 96 is in decimal virtual key code.
